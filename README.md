Agriculture plays a vital role in India’s economy. 
 Due to various factors like insufficient irrigation, unfavorable soil or
 atmospheric conditions, etc, the farmers who make up the majority,
 do not achieve the expected yield on their crops. By studying the
 soil and atmosphere for the specific area, which increases crop
 production, optimal crops can be estimated which shall further
 benefit the farmers and the overall country as well.
 Hence data mining and machine learning techniques can be
 incorporated to assist in the analysis of crop yield prediction
 therefore enabling farmers and other policymakers to make
 informed decisions.

  The primary goal of this project is to analyze different
 predictive models for crop yield prediction of various crops
 (e.g., wheat, rice, maize) in a given region of India.
 The different models are evaluated for their accuracy as well.
 For predicting annual crop yield, the Random Forest model
 emerges as the most effective among all the other models,
 achieving the lowest MAE and a high R² score of 0.9841,
 reflecting its accuracy and robustness.
